   Exchange Store — CP1 Flowcharts (ASCII)

   Overview:
   This program is a simple, menu-driven currency exchange simulation. The main flows are:

   1) Perform an exchange
      [Start]
        |
        v
      [Show Menu] --(select Convert)--> [Prompt: FROM currency]
        |
        v
      [Validate selection] --no--> [Re-prompt]
        |
        v
      [Prompt: TO currency] --> [Validate selection]
        |
        v
      [Prompt: Amount] --> [Validate amount]
        |
        v
      [Compute exchange using current rates]
        |
        v
      [Display result, optionally produce receipt and log to CSV] --> [Back to Menu]

   2) Show rates
      [Show Menu] --(select Show rates)--> [Print current rates table] --> [Back to Menu]

   3) Management (set rates / adjust reserves / critical minimums)
      [Show Menu] --(select Management options)--> [Prompt for manager actions] --> [Update in-memory state]

   4) End-of-day report
      [Show Menu] --(select End-of-day report)--> [Read daily CSV file] --> [Summarize total transactions and profit] --> [Back to Menu]

   5) Help / About
      [Show Menu] --(select Help)--> [Print program information, instructions, and file locations] --> [Back to Menu]

   6) Additional utilities
      - Add manual transaction (append to CSV)
      - List transactions for a date (print CSV lines)
      - Search transaction by ID (search CSV for tx_id column)

   Notes:
    - The program maintains daily CSV files named sales_YYYY-MM-DD.csv and receipts_YYYY-MM-DD.txt
    - CSV parsing supports both legacy rows (no tx_id) and new rows (with tx_id). Searching by tx_id works only when tx_id is present in the CSV.
    - The Makefile contains convenient targets: build (default), run, test, install, clean.
